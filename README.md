# AddressBook

## What's this?

This is a homework assignment, which requires to implement an addressbook.

At the time being it does not support Windows platform, since `termios.h` has been referred somewhere in the project.
Multi-language support is indeed on my ToDo list but as for now with low priority. Sorry.

No, I have no idea why I've written 3500+ lines of code for it.

## Getting started

Run these commands in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/refexchange/addressbook.git`

`cmake .`

`make`


## Todo

- Imporve robustness of CSV serializer

- Win32 support

- I18n

- ehh....Making it simple, stupid?

## Contributing

Any PRs or issues are welcomed as long as you can tolerate the shitty code I wrote.
